# Development & release status

<div class="lb-status-panel">
  <div class="lb-status-title">Source-ready does not mean game-ready</div>
  <p>Automated tests for portable game logic have passed, but the project still lacks verified Unreal Editor/UHT compilation, an authentic cooked circuit map, installed driving QA and official game binaries. This website itself is only documentation.</p>

## Current milestone

| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| Latest published GitHub pre-release | [v0.5.76](https://github.com/sanskarIN/latebrake/releases/tag/v0.5.76), **source only**, zero runnable assets |
| Latest source-development milestone | **v0.5.77 merged, unreleased**: bounded interpolation for the advisory launch-speed estimate, with interruption and same-clock guards. **v0.5.76 is published** at independently source-qualified commit `de975173e899a180f123feea93c9a2c64e5cc66c` and adds measured forward 0–5 km/h feedback after the v0.5.75 green-light gate. Real Unreal 5.8/UHT compilation, an original cooked circuit and installed phone/desktop QA remain unavailable |
| Engine targets | Unreal Engine 5.8 + C++20 |
| Cross-platform portable tests | Windows, Ubuntu, macOS GitHub Actions |
| Unreal Editor/UHT | **Not yet verified** |
| Authentic project map cooking | **Not yet verified** |
| Windows playable binary | **Not available / not verified** |
| Android APK and real-device QA | **Not available / not verified** |
| Documentation website | GitHub Pages build, not game validation |

## What needs to happen before a stable release?

1. Compile the real Unreal Editor and game targets on an authorized UE 5.8 installation.
2. Create and cook the project-owned circuit map in Unreal Editor. Verify startup, collision and ordered gates through real runtime logs and driving.
3. Package genuine Windows/Android candidate artifacts. Verify platform structure and source/map identity using the existing scripts.
4. Test installed candidates, including pause, touch, physics, recovery, save loading, checkpoint timing and career progression.
5. Record honest QA evidence for **each exact package** before promoting it to a playable pre-release or stable release.
